# Minecraft Server Query w/ Email
This script uses the MCStatus Python library to check the status of each server in the `hosts.csv` file. Servers that are down send an email automatically to the one specified in `email_credentials.csv`, with the login specified in the same file.

## Setup
`email_credentials.csv`
